Sun Jul 16 2006 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* support for static builds, patch by Marc Zonzon
	* check for fuse_new instead of fuse_main

	  Reported by Andrew Schretter, and patched in January, but I forgot to
	  commit fix.

	* add 1.2.4 release notes to spec
	* have configure generate po/Makefile
	* add changelog entries

Wed Aug 24 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* raw dir may not be a subdirectory of mount point
	  Fixes issue reported by paulgfx - if raw directory was a subdirectory
	  of the mount point, this would cause infinite recursion (because each
	  request by encfs on the raw data would be translated into another
	  encfs request by the kernel).
	* moves the directory creation until the other tests have been made, to
	  avoid creating directories unless all sanity checks pass.

Tue Aug 23 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* avoid trying to decipher impossibly small filenames
	  Bug reported by paulgfx - if a bogus file was placed in the encfs raw
	  directory with a name that was too small to be a valid encrypted
	  name, it could cause encfs to segfault.  Such files are now skipped.

Sat Aug 20 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* add support for static build
	  In static builds, the linker skips objects from the libencfs library
	  which are never directly referenced.  This breaks all encoding and
	  encryption modules, because they are dynamically registered.  The
	  workaround is to explicitly add references in the library in the
	  static build case.

Wed Aug 17 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* bump version to 1.2.4
	* refactor small amount of error code
	* add environment override for config file location
	  If the environment variable 'ENCFS5_CONFIG' is set, then it will be
	  used as the location for the encfs configuration file.  Otherwise,
	  the normal search will be done, by searching the specified root
	  directory for an appropriate config file.

Fri Aug 5 2005 jjhellst@gmail.com
	* Remove duplicate initFS and checkDir calls
	  Remove duplicated calls to initFS by refactoring call to initFS into
	  initRootInfo function that calls checkDir and initFS.  This removes
	  some of the redundancy in cmd_* handlers.
	  The creation of destDir in cmd_export is also moved to a later stage,
	  so that if encfs volume couldn't be initialized, the destination
	  directory is not created.

Fri Jul 29 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>

	way to get it.
	* minor cleanup with locking of DirNode & FileNode
	doesn't change lock regions or behavior, but cleans it up a bit.
	Locks added in constructors even though they aren't necessary in order
	to try and get valgrind's helgrind to not report a race there.. but
	didn't work
	* always warn of MAC comparison failure
	if warnonly mode is not turned enabled, then an error will also be
	thrown

Mon Jul 4 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* register nullname io
	Once had a request for unencrypted filenames (only data encrypted).
	Easy enough by having NullNameIO registered as an option.
	* synchronize read path
	After fixing the paranoia mode problem in the earlier patch, that seems
	to introduce (or exacerbate?) a race condition in the read path.  Until
	I have time to track it down, the safest action seems to be to
	synchronize reads..
	* add 'cat' command to encfsctl
	Allows printing out the contents of a file without having to mount the
	filesystem.

Sun Jul 3 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* another fix to allow symbolic links to /
	Bug report by neuron.
	* allow symbolic link to root directory

Sat Jul 2 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* don't call setIV on symbolic links
	Only call setIV for regular file types and non-existant files.
	This is a fix for a problem with symbolic links which was reported to
	debian bug tracking system: bug #315624 Affects paranoia mode (IV
	chaining + file headers + external IV chaining)

Mon Jun 20 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* update libtool

Thu Jun 16 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>

	* fix build error on rh7.3
	* bump version to 1.2.2
	* tagged v1.2.2

Tue May 17 2005  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* fix idle monitor thread
	  Idle monitor wasn't working in encfs 1.2.x - reported by Patrick
	  Skerrett on encfs-users mailing list.  Problem was that idle thread
	  needs to be setup after daemon() is called by libfuse, otherwise
	  thread was being killed.
	* increment libencfs version number to 1:1:0

Fri May 13 2005  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* add use_ino by default, new flag --no-default-flags
	  The fuse flags use_ino is now specified by default, since it
	  shouldn't cost anything.  Encfs now has a documented flag
	  --no-default-flags which can be used to turn off all default fuse
	  flags.
	* add big warning message for external IV chaining
	  External IV chaining causes known problems with programs like mutt
	  and procmail, so show a big warning message if it has been enabled,
	  just so there isn't any surprise.

Tue May 10 2005  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* fix memory leak on MAC error
	  When a block MAC error is detected, an exception is thrown, but a
	  local memory-pool buffer is not released, leading to a leak of a
	  block.

Fri May  6 2005  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* add last-block cache

Sun May  1 2005  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>

2005-04-18  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* add "--public" mount option when encfs is run as root, to act as a
	  standard multi-user filesystem.  Based on patch by Sascha Demetrio.
	* enable shared library build.  Encfs and encfsctl now link to libencfs
	  shared library.

2005-04-15  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* provide more scriptable password mechanism, patch from Gerald Klix
	* internal development moved to Darcs revision control (because
	  Bitkeeper folks have shown why open source projects should not rely
	  upon it).

2005-04-08  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* build libencfs shared library - 

2005-04-01  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>

	  password program.  Fixes problem of fixed descriptor number
	  conflicting with password return socket in some circumstances. 
	  Found by Olivier Dournaux.

	* drop support for older libfuse versions of fuse_main which do not
	  return an integer error code.

2005-02-09  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* log debug messages of error conditions to Info channel instead of
	  Debug

	* fix bug in MAC header code which caused corruption in files > 2GB
	  Reported by Damian Frank.

2005-02-05  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* convert to fuse 2.2 api, dropping support for older versions

	* change encfs version to 1.2

	* add inode number pass-thru support, allowing inode numbers to be the
	  same as the underlying filesystem.  This makes it so that hard links
	  will have the same inode number (which some programs check)..

	* minor i18n changes

	* initial i18n support

2004-11-23  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* add -H option to get fuse_mount usage message

2004-11-08  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* check if fuse_main returns integer.  Should allow encfs to build with
	  older versions of fuse

	* fix fuse argument separation for recent versions of fuse (fix
	  reported by Bill Cox).

	* fix problems with recursive rename undo (reported by Rorick Olson,
	  and possibly others).

2004-11-03  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* lots of cleanup of configuration scripts, since they wouldn't work
	  with the most recent autoconf tools.

	* fixes for recursive rename which was failing because it expected
	  directories to have IV headers.

2004-10-29  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* add flag to allow file holes in BlockFileIO

	* fix for sourceforge bug 1056718 - wrong error code from getxattr

	* 1.1.8 release
	* TAG: v1.1.8

2004-08-13  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* Fix some problems with MAC block header processing.  Backward
	  compatibility is maintained for people who were not experiencing
	  problems.  The new code is much faster, and should be more reliable
	  as well..

2004-08-12  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* minor fixes, test for known error conditions early in filename decode
	  path
	
	* TAG: v1.1.7-2

	* add support for forced decoding in the case of MAC checksum failure

2004-08-11  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* update version and notes for 1.1.7-2
	* TAG: v1.1.7-2

	* fix error in truncate() on unopened file

	* version change to 1.1.7

	* fixes to build on RedHat 7.3 (or system with old OpenSSL) fix race
	  condition in CipherV3

2004-08-09  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* Fix bug which would allow multiple files to be created with the same
	  file IV header.

	* Add mlock calls in case user has permission to lock regions of memory.

	* Add support for IV chaining to old 0.x filesystem support code.  This
	  code is still useful when building on a system that doesn't have a
	  recent version of OpenSSL (such as RedHat 7.x)

	* TAG: v1.1.6

2004-07-22  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* bump version to 1.1.5
	* TAG: v1.1.5

	* TAG: v1.1.4

2004-07-09  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* add external password prompt support.

	* remove explicit file hiding support, as hidefile operations changes
	  were not integrated 

	* into FUSE (but the libfuse internal handling changes were).

2004-07-01  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* fix rename warning to print entire path.
	* disable libfuse V2's default background mode.

2004-06-24  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* cleanup for 1.1.3 release - notes in man page, RELEASE tag update..
	* TAG: v1.1.3

	* hard links cannot be supported with external IV chaining.  Return
	  error if attempted.

	* avoid uninitialized memory warnings

	* add support for filename -> data IV chaining.

2004-06-23  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* Feature: 
	    add support for fuse_operations.hidefile - which allows
	    delete-on-open and rename-on-open operation support. This allows
	    Evolution mail reader to work much better.

	* Security: 
	    don't log plaintext filename in fsync.

	* Other: 
	    use atomic operations if bits/atomicity.h found.  
	    Add more sanity checks with rAssert.

2004-06-19  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* added atomic lookup/open api to DirNode to simplify logic.
	* add ability to store symbolic links to fully qualified path names.
	* add ring buffer cache for unopened FileNode entries.
	* make locking logic more robust in case of exceptions.

2004-06-16  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* minor updates

	* some minor updates

2004-06-08  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* merge RedHat 7.3 build fixes

2004-06-07  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* fix build problems on RedHat 7.3 system

2004-05-28  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* documentation updates for 1.1.x.
	* add extra includes necessary for some platforms...

	* updates for 1.1.2 release

2004-05-26  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* work around potential race condition with unlink.

	* add undo to recursive renames to that a failed rename will undo
	  changes.

2004-05-24  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* update version to 1.1.2

	* Fix bug reported by Jens Arm -- change CipherFileIO and MACFileIO to
	  only adjust size for regular files (not directories, etc).   This bug
	  prevented EncFS from being used on top of an XFS filesystem..

2004-05-23  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* add support for decoding a list of names from stdin in encfsctl.

2004-05-22  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* fix up includes so that extra dependency path discovered in configure
	  get included..

2004-05-20  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* change release to 1.1.1-2
	* fix possible race condition in cipher by locking around use of cipher
	  state variables.  

	* make recursive rename more robust and also propogate changes to
	  denormalized values.

2004-05-19  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* change release to 1.1.1-1
	* add release number to tar builds

	* add support for file rename while open, needed for Evolution to work
	  properly.

	* add variable size blockMAC headers (and random byte components), as
	  random bytes are not needed when file IV headers are enabled.

	* New V5 configuration subversion - 20040518.

	* add try/catch blocks around most operations in encfs.cpp, as uncaught
	  exceptions will cause fuse library to exit.

	* add decode command to encfsctl to decode an encrypted path name.

	* fix memory bounds error in MACFileIO

2004-05-18  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* bump release to 4
	* TAG: v1.1-4

	* add showcruft command to encfsctl which displays undecodable filenames

	* make recursive rename two stages to avoid trying to rename files more
	  then once.

	* add recursive directory renaming if directory IV chaining is enabled,
	  otherwise directory contents are not visible after a rename.

2004-05-17  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* change password prompt text.
	* eliminate harmless uninitialized memory read warning from valgrind.
	* TAG: v1.1

2004-05-14  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* add padding to conversion array to avoid possible array bounds read
	  error with invalid filenames

	* allow CipherV3 to be built even if newer SSL interfaces are not
	  available.

	* add full V3 support (filesystems created by EncFS 0.2 - 0.6)

2004-05-13  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* documentation updates

	* minor documentation updates

	* add documentation of filesystem options to man page

2004-05-12  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* add reference counting for open/release calls, since FUSE can have
	  overlapping retain/release states on a file.

	* fix multiple delete in main exit cleanup.

	* lots of changes to DirNode and FileNode classes to make more thread
	  safe.  The threading problems seemed to be mostly due to the way
	  FileNodes were created and passed around.

	* add xattr support (untested) since I noticed new calls in the FUSE
	  library header from CVS.

	* changed open file caching to be based on plaintext name rather then
	  encrypted name.  FUSE passes the plaintext names to EncFS for
	  processing, so rather then having to encrypt them each time, use the
	  plaintext name for lookup in the cache.  This makes it more likely to
	  have plaintext names sitting around in memory, so I've tried to have
	  the names get cleared when they are no longer in use.

2004-05-04  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* merge FlatDirNode into DirNode.  There is no longer a need to have
	  the base class separate since the purpose was in doing per-directory
	  initialization vectors, which are no longer necessary now with
	  filename IV chaining and per-file IV headers.

	* add 64-bit IV chaining implementations to StreamNameIO and
	  BlockNameIO.

	* add means of finding out current interface of NameIO and Cipher
	  instances.

2004-05-03  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* fix build error with current fuse CVS snapshot

2004-05-01  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* fix checksum decoding bug when IV chaining is not enabled.

2004-04-30  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* Add filename IV chaining mode.  Found an easy way to add per-file
	  initialization vectors.  I thought I was going to have to store
	  per-directory IV data somewhere (or like CVS, store IV data in
	  strange parts of file headers), but I found I could do much better
	  more simply by chaining the initialization vectors during a path
	  encode/decode since EncFS always knows the full path of the file
	  being accessed.  This adds 64 bits of path-dependent initialization
	  vector data without any storage overhead.

2004-04-28  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* Thanks to Anthony Iano-Fletcher for helping test the 1.1 beta.  It
	  was quickly discovered that there was a race condition, so the 1.1
	  release is delayed pending fixes.

	* Add support for initialization vector argument to NameIO name
	  encoding methods.  

	* Add mknod method to FileNode, remove blockSize().
	* Fix warnings from valgrind regarding uninitialized memory access.

2004-04-20  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* TAG: v1.1
	* fix problems found when running rsync, as suggested by Anthony Iano-Fletcher.

2004-04-17  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* fix assert failure from showFSInfo due to BlockNameIO being
	  instanciated with null cipher.

2004-04-16  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* some minor updates - mostly comment additions in preparation for 1.1 release

	* fix uninitialized memory read.

	* change BlockNameIO implementation to include padding bytes in MAC.
	* configuration selection and display changes.

2004-04-15  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* add per-file initialization vector support.  Stores 64-bit
	  initialization vector modifier for each file.  The IV vector is
	  stored encrypted as a transparent header on the file.

	* add a prompt for MAC headers in setup, and show information about
	  filesystem to user.

	* add option to turn off key validation checking

	* add support for per-block MAC headers which ensure data within a
	  block cannot be modified without being detected.

2004-04-14  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* name encoding output for encfsctl and added creator tag to V5 config
	  file.

	* V5 configuration, now supports block mode filename encryption.

2004-04-13  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* botan updates.  The botan API is a complex beast.  I may drop it and
	  instead focus on adding support for something more likely to be found
	  on a system - like mcrypt or gcrypt.

2004-04-12  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* implement Block name encoding.  This hides the size of filenames to
	  some extent.  

	* renamed StdNameIO to StreamNameIO.

	* Clean up Cipher API and eliminate special case name
	  encoding/decoding, which is now part of NameIO logic.

	* Move code from FileNode to FileIO layer to clean up layer separation.

	* Support for version 3 filesystems (created by EncFS 0.x, supported by
	  0.x and 1.0.x) has been dropped. 

2004-04-11  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* remove blockSize from static Cipher constructors.
	* change name of stream encoding interfaces.

2004-04-10  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* change to using smart pointer types and OpaqueValue as CipherKey.
	  memory ownership was starting to become too complex, so I imported a
	  smart pointer class from 'rel' codebase (where Interface and
	  LinkedOwner came from).

	* port truncate fix from mainline.  Use Mutex::Lock helper class for
	  locking

2004-04-09  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* Cipher interface no longer expects a unique short name.

	* FileUtils contains functions for loading / creating filesystem
	  configuration.

	* First try implementation of an 'ls' command in encfsctl.

2004-04-08  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* add support for truncate call with new size > old size.

	* trivial changes

2004-04-08  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* release version 1.0.5

	* add support for truncate call with new size > old size.

2004-03-26  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* release version 1.0.4

	* fix signalling to idle monitoring thread to avoid getting stuck
	  waiting for it.

2004-03-25  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* Update comments in README and INSTALL

	* Make RELEASE a config variable.  Sets release number in spec files so
	  that it only needs to be set in once place.

	* Found that 1.x series was slower then 0.x series due to EVP cipher
	  context usage.  Large speed improvements in SSL_Cipher by optimizing
	  EVP cipher context lifetime.

	* Optimize read and write to go direct to buffer whenever possible.
	  This is the fastest encfs ever.

	* Don't remove files that are not automatically generated.  Caused a
	  distribution build problem when the admin directory was updated.
	  Workaround for make dist complaining about Makefile.am.wo

	* configure.in: use standard "yes" instead of "ok" in result message

2004-03-24  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* Another block padding fix to ensure blocks are padded with '0's

	* Check for a supported libfuse API at configure time.

	* Add support for FUSE_MAJOR_VERSION 2 (the current CVS version of
	  FUSE), which changes the statfs interface.

	* Update admin code.

2004-03-21  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* encfsctl.pod: fix comment

2004-03-19  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* update README with better description of encryption details

2004-03-18  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* TAG: v1.0.3

	* fix truncate bug - truncate was seriously broken, and could cause
	  corruption of a truncated block!

	* Tested filesystem using a perl script which tries to cause as many
	  edge cases as possible w.r.t. partial blocks..  It showed up the
	  problem with padding and truncation..

2004-03-17  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* main.cpp:
	    remove old warning for extra args

	* fix padding bug where some blocks were getting padded with random
	  data instead of with zeros.

	* Remove uncessary padding in the last block of a file, since it gets
	  overwritten by the write call immediatly afterwards.  Should speed up
	  partial block writes.

	* switch to getopt for argument parsing, and support GNU style long arguments

	* add inactivity timeout support (--idle option)

2004-03-14  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>
	* TAG: v1.0.2
